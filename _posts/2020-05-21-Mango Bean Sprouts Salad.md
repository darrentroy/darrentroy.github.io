- 40	grams Coriander
- 1/2	pack Bean Sprouts
- 1/4	cup, halves and pieces Cashew Nuts, Oil Roasted
- 1/2	pepper Peppers, Hot Chili, Red
- 1/2	cup, sliced Mangos
- 1	tbsp Soy Sauce
- 1	1tsp Oil, Sesame
- 1/2	fruit (2-1/8" dia) Lemons
- 1/2	tbsp Honey Squeezable


Start the salad by emptying the beansprouts into a large bowl. Place a few coriander leaves to one side to use later as a garnish then remove the remaining leaves from the stalks. Slice up the stalks and add them to the beansprouts.

Place a frying pan on a low heat, then add a splash of olive oil and the cashews. Toast them until they start to colour.

Remove the pan containing the cashews from the heat and drizzle over the honey, making sure the cashews are completely coated.

Finely slice the chili half and peel the mango with a speed peeler. Remove the stone from the mango, slice or cube it, then add it to the salad along with the chili and cashews.

Dress the salad with soy sauce, sesame oil, extra virgin olive oil and the juice from one lemon or lime. If you're unsure about quantities, keep tasting as you go.
